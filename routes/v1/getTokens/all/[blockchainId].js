 *     description: |
 *       Returns all tokens that can be found in Curve pools, on a specific chain.
 *       Pools need at least $10k TVL for tokens to make this list.
 *
 *       Note that tokensâ€™ `usdPrice` is very simply the usd price of that token reported
 *       by the largest Curve pool on that chain, at that one point in time. There is no effort
 *       made to average or smooth out those prices, they should be used for presentation purposes only.

/**
 * This endpoint, along with all bulk getPools endpoints, is only cached at the CDN level:
 * it uses the `maxAgeCDN` prop only.
 *
 * This approach allows to take advantage of:
 * 1. Redis caching of all combinations pools(blockchainId, registryId): these are already
 *    cached and available, so this is very fast, the server only assembles them
 * 2. CDN caching: Cloudfront makes this assembled, large amount of data, available
 *    close to all API consumers
 *
 * This has two advantages:
 * 1. Redis isn't bloated with large amounts of data that are already stored in it
 *    in their unassembled form
 * 2. The server doesn't need to do that assembling too often, CDN caching makes sure of that
